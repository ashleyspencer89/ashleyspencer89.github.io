        <div class="subheading mb-5">Legal Assistant/ParalegalðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">In 2024 I will earn my bachelorâ€™s degree in sociology from the University of California, Riverside and my associate of science in paralegal studies from Mt. San Antonio College. In 2022 I earned four associates of arts degrees in psychology, sociology, philosophy, and liberal arts while being an active member of student and campus activities. Now, I work in a restaurant to help me pay for school and support my family. These experiences will culminate to aid me in starting a career in paralegal work/legal assisting. I have consistently taken on a massive amount of work in hopes of proving that what I lack in experience I can make up for in a willingness to learn, an ability to catch on quickly, and a desire to become better and more efficient every day. 
While going to school, I also work in a restaurant as a supervisor, bartender, and server. I am closely mentored by my general manager who aims to teach me how to run a successful business from the books to the output. In the restaurant I am in charge of the bar, hosts, and bussers which is a combined a team of 23 people. I steer the crew to follow company standards, ensure we are practicing proper cash handling procedures, and also performing responsible alcohol service on each shift. I am also accountable for the liquor orders each week which help us maintain our sales and make more money for the company. 
<br><br>

        My job in the restaurant involves many duties outside of the departments I am assigned. Every weekend I am expected to close the restaurant, run a profitable and cost-effective shift with few guest complaints or other issues. A the end of the night I am responsible for balancing the money for the entire restaurant and safely locking up for the evening. I also assist with kitchen duties such as food count and end of the night waste. I am a part of a team that directs the culture of the entire crew who was more recently very unmotivated and complacent. Together, we have turned this team around and continue to collect accolades as a result.<br><br>

        Overall, I have a wide array of experience in various fields. I spent over a year working in an office in one of my schools helping the Black Student Program bounce back from the pandemicâ€™s effects. Our goals here were driving student participation and finding resources to further aid the students who were struggling. This included everything from extra funding, special trips, dinners, movie screenings, and any other activity we could get approved that would help us get students back to feeling a sense of normalcy. Ideally, I will be attending law school at some point in my life but until that time comes, I hope to make a profitable career in the legal field as a paralegal assisting in wills and trusts as well as a lucrative at-home legal assisting job. Ultimately, I hope to start a business where I can work remotely for several firms at one time while assisting people with wills and trusts on the side.
